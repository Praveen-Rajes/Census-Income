# UCI Census Income Data Machine Learning

This repository contains code for performing machine learning on the UCI Census Income dataset using Random Forest and Naive Bayes algorithms.

## Dataset

The UCI Census Income dataset is a widely used dataset for predicting whether a person's income exceeds $50K per year based on various demographic features. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income).


## Usage

>  Preprocess the data:
   Train the Random Forest model:
   Train the Naive Bayes model:

    ```shell
    CourseWork.ipynb
    ```



## Results

The results of the machine learning models will be displayed in the console. Additionally, the trained models will be saved for future use.
